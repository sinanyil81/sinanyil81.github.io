## Objectives
The objective of the course is to expose students to languages, operating systems and, in general, programming techniques geared towards Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These applications run on devices that are often embedded in the environment (e.g., to operate sensors and/or actuators) therefore requiring modes of interaction significantly different from traditional, user-driven applications. Further, these devices are usually small, battery-powered, and constrained in terms of computation and communication resources, therefore posing peculiar system-level challenges. The course will provide a general context on IoT applications before delving in the illustration of paradigmatic approaches to IoT programming. Some of the latter will be further explored hands-on in laboratory sessions, where students will have the opportunity to build their own applications using real IoT hardware.

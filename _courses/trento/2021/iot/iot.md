## Objectives
Contemporary Internet of Things (IoT) systems comprise embedded computing devices that enable perceiving information about anything, at any time and from anywhere. These devices are interconnected, often embedded in the environment, small in size, battery-powered, and constrained in terms of computation and communication resources. These properties pose peculiar system-level challenges to develop IoT applications.

The objective of this course is to expose students to programming languages, hardware platforms, operating systems, and, in general, the necessary software tools and techniques geared towards the development of IoT applications. By the end of this course, the students are expected to acquire the theoretical and practical skills to interface with state-of-the-art embedded computing platforms. They will be equipped with the fundamentals to design and develop IoT applications, including, but not limited to, electrocardiogram sensing and interpretation, image processing with low-resolution cameras, machine learning on the edge, wireless localization, and many more.

Upon successful completion of this module, students should be able to:
- Characterize the main architectural components of microcontroller-based IoT platforms
- Use the development environments and toolchains to program and debug microcontrollers
- Design, implement and test embedded software by following the fundamental methodologies for IoT systems
- Assess IoT application performance and understand the techniques used for optimizing systems execution
- Characterize the basics of real-time scheduling and the main components of embedded real-time operating systems

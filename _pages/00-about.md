Welcome to my homepage! I am currently an Assistant professor  <a href='http://unitn.it'>University of Trento</a>, <a href='http://disi.unitn.it'>Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science</a>. I created this website to share the output of my studies and be reachable. 

I am interested in the research problems of low-power and networked embedded sensing systems. Together with my learning partners, we study sensor networks, wireless protocols, self-organizing and distributed algorithms, operating systems/run-times, architectural support, digital design, intermittent computing, and tiny machine learning. I am a member of [HIPEAC](https://www.hipeac.net/) community.

You can find more info about me [here](info/index.html). Source codes I have developed in the past are [here](/projects/index.html).

You can check [ENT-Lab Research Group](https://sinanyil81.github.io/entlab/) to see the brilliant researchers I am working together and our software releases.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

As Embedded and Networked Things Group (ENT-Lab), we aim to explore cross-cutting research problems and gaps concerning the hardware and software for networked embedded systems having extreme resource and energy constraints. We study problems at the intersection of embedded systems, internet of things (IoT), wireless communication and network protocols, self-organizing sensor networks, distributed algorithms, operating systems/run-times and many more.

Our current research activities include:
- Software systems and programming support for intermittent computing
- Architectural (hardware) support for intermittent computing
- Batteryless and intermittent networking
- Tiny machine learning on the batteryless edge.
